              I'm a fullstack developer with a backend roots, frontend focus and
              a product mindset. I've worked on everything from greenfield apps
              to multi-year legacy systems, often bridging the gap between
              design, tech, and business needs. I care about building things
              that make sense for the user and the team behind it â€” and I enjoy
              working in collaborative, feedback-driven environments.
            </p>
            <p>
              My strongest experience is with React, TypeScript, and Ruby on
              Rails, but I try to stay tech-agnostic and choose tools that fit
              the problem, not the other way around. I've worked in agile teams,
              led frontend and backend development on larger features, and
              contributed across the stack when needed. I'm also PSPO I
              certified, and I often work closely with designers and product
              folks to turn ideas into something real.
            </p>
            <p>
              Over the years, I've worked across different industries and team
              setups â€” from fast-moving startups to more structured environments
              â€” often in remote, international teams. I value clear
              communication, flexibility, and taking ownership â€” not just of the
              features I build, but of the product as a whole. I approach
              development with a mix of curiosity, pragmatism, and care for both
              the technical and human side of the work.
            </p>

              After hours, I enjoy watching F1 and NBA basketball (Miami Heat
